Overview
========
This repository delivers a framework that was created to help manage the DevOps process for releases that involve a 
large number of components and/or that need a standard process for managing components and how they are delivered.

The framework provides a set of objects intended to manage each major phase of a CI/CD pipeline into which custom logic
can be placed that will then be execute at the correct place, so removing the need for linking jobs together or building
custom flow logic into your pipeline.

For example, a `Build` object is present that allows you to register callbacks for operations like: -
- Cleaning work areas
- Getting code
- Running a build process
- Running a unit-test process
- Running a static code analysis process etc.

All you need to do is register callbacks to do your own specific build logic or unit-test process etc. and the framework
will manage all the running of that process and the coordination with other steps.

The framework also provides a small set of "most commonly used functions" service library to help "kick-start" your CI/CD
process if needed. These functions include operations like: -
- Slack notification
- Email
- Container services
- SCM services
- various file based services

These can be used (if needed) from Jenkins or command line.

Framework Plugins for Jenkins
-----------------------------
The framework provides two different plugins for Jenkins. The first of these is a shared library which is used to provide
the CI/CD framework (and service) objects discussed below. The second is a set of DSL extensions which - if installed 
as a Jenkins plugin - provides a set of DSL extensions which can be used in a Jenkins pipeline syntax. These are also 
discussed below.

Framework Objects
=================
The framework is split into two main pipelines: -
- The CI process for individual products/components 
- The CD process for integrated releases

The CI process is used to manage the build, deploy and test processes for each individual component and the CD process 
is used to manage the integration and release phases.

The main interface objects for controlling these phases are shown below: -

>| Class | Description | 
>| ----- | ----------- |
>| `CIFramework` | Which is used to control your CI process (Build, Deploy and Test process) |
>| `CDFramework` | Which is used to control your CD process (Integration and Release candidate verification process)|

The `CIFramework` interface is split into three main phases - each of which are controlled by a specific object: -

>| Class | Description | 
>| ----- | ----------- |
>| `Build` | Which is used to control your build process |
>| `Deploy` | Which is used to control your deployment process |
>| `Test` | Which is used to control your test process |

Likewise, the `CDFramework` interface is split into two main phases - each of which are controlled by a specific object
as well: -

>| Class | Description | 
>| ----- | ----------- |
>| `Integration` | Which is used to control your integration process |
>| `ReleaseCandidate` | Which is used to control your Release candidate process |

These interface objects allow you to register the callbacks that you want to use for each main process - like build - 
and then the framework will take care of running these callbacks in the correct flow and managing the coordination between
the steps.

Service Objects
===============
The framework also provides a number of "service" objects aimed at providing commonly required DevOps capabilities like 
cloning code, running Docker images, sending emails etc. These services are provided to help make a DevOps implementation
easier to do by providing working services and utilities that are commonly required.

>| Class | Description | 
>| ----- | ----------- |
>| `Notifications` | For email and [Slack](https://slack.com) IRC messaging | 
>| `SCM` | For GIT and SVN SCM function(s) - currently only supporting cloning |
>| `Container` | For various container management commands - currently only supporting [Docker](https://www.docker.com) |
>| `Repository` | For pushing and pulling files from repos - currently only file, [Artifactory](https://jfrog.com/artifactory/) and [Nexus OSS v2](https://www.sonatype.com/nexus-repository-oss) are supported |
>| `ComponentManifest` | For maintaining your manifest of integrated components. This is the list of component names, versions, status and locations that you register with the manifest. These can then be accessed later on for usage in other testing or release processes |
>| `Provision` | For running provisioning scripts - currently only Ansible is supported |

So, why have a DevOps framework
===============================
As mentioned above, the framework is primarily provided as a way of allowing you to control - in a standard way - 
how products are on-boarded into CI/CD and how that process is then managed. It does this in two ways. Firstly,
by providing a standard framework into which product-teams can implement their CI processes, so ensuring everyone
is using the same guidelines. Secondly, by having the framework manage the process flow of the overall steps and
the coordination between them.

The Problem Statement
---------------------
As an organization with many products or different components in place, transferring these all over to a CI/CD process
may be a bit daunting - especially if they each use different types of technologies or build processes. Without a 
framework in place, those products may each end up implementing their own CI/CD process or technology, making the 
management and integration of those products a big challenge.

Integration of products and the management of that process is also a big problematic area. A release that is made up
of many products means that you need to track which versions of products have been released, which versions are
in test and how they can work with each other. If, for example, your release if made up of 20 different products
managing the status and dependencies of those products could be a large task. This is something the framework can
do for you by managing the list of components and how they are promoted through the release pipeline.

Also, by extending the base framework, you can implement specific customisations that you might want to apply
to every product - like security scans - that cannot be "forgotten" or missed when teams implement their own CD
processes.

The Implementation
------------------
The framework has been implemented using Groovy/Java based callbacks. This means that you can easily integrate it into
Jenkins pipelines as a shared library or use it standalone. The callback mechanism means that virtually any CLI or 
API based build technology can be run using it, so it is totally flexible regarding the CI/CD processes it can wrap. 

Examples of both standalone and Jenkins pipeline implementations are provided.

Framework Process Flows
=======================
The process flows provided by the framework are described below.

The Overall Process Flow
------------------------
The overall process flow is that used to implement the CI/CD pipeline. The picture below shows how this works.

>![Overall Process flow](https://github.com/tpayne/devops-framework/blob/master/devops-framework-pipeline/src/main/resources/OverallFrameworkFlow.jpg)

Individual products use a standard CI build, deploy and test process to verify their changes are working as expected. 
These are then promoted to the component manifest for further testing in an integrated flow.

In the context of a release end to end flow, the framework works as shown in the picture below. The CI process is used
for feature development and the CD process is used for the release verification. Quality gates are implemented using 
the test processes to determine if components should be added to the component manifest and to determine if the release
candidate can be promoted to production.

>![E2E Process flow](https://github.com/tpayne/devops-framework/blob/master/devops-framework-pipeline/src/main/resources/DevOpsE2EOverview.jpg)


The CI Process Flow
-------------------
The CI process flow controls the component or product-level build, deploy and test process. This pipeline works as
follows.

>![CI Process flow](https://github.com/tpayne/devops-framework/blob/master/devops-framework-pipeline/src/main/resources/CIFrameworkProcessFlow.jpg)

When a product has finished with the testing process, then it will be promoted to the component manifest to make it a
candidate for integration testing.

The CD Process Flow
-------------------
When an update is detected to the component manifest, this kicks off the CD flow which then runs the integration and other
release verification processes to ensure that the release stack is ready for deployment to production. This pipeline flow 
is shown below.

>![CD Process flow](https://github.com/tpayne/devops-framework/blob/master/devops-framework-pipeline/src/main/resources/CDFrameworkProcessFlow.jpg)

Jenkins and Compiler Support
============================
The framework will only run with the following: -
- JDK 8+ (javac 1.8.0_201+)
- Jenkis LTS 2.164.1+

You can downgrade the versions by modifying the `pom.xml` file, but you will also need to downgrade any dependent plugins.

The framework has only been compiled and tested using the documented versions above (and the latest versions of Jenkins 2.168).

How to Install
==============
To install this [Jenkins share library](https://jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/shared-libraries), do the following...

	1) git clone https://github.com/tpayne/devops-framework.git
	2) cd devops-framework
	3) mvn package
	4) cd devops-framework-pipeline/target/
	5) Unzip devops-framework-pipeline-dsl-pack.zip into a working directory
	6) Use the instructions in the Jenkins Wiki (https://jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/shared-libraries/#global-shared-libraries) to install the shared library into your Jenkins system

You will need to configure the unit-tests as discussed below and install/configure `Docker` and `Ansible` as they are used
during the test process. If you want to just build the packages without doing any unit-tests, then you can do this via...

	mvn clean package -Dmaven.test.skip=true
	
This will build the packages only.

The Jenkins DSL HPI plugin will automatically be built via the `mvn package` command. The HPI file is situated in the 
`devops-framework-plugin/target` directory and is loaded into Jenkins using the advanced plugin manager option in 
the Jenkins management console. This is the same as any standard file-based Jenkins plugin.

How to Use
==========
The shared library works by providing controller classes that you can use in a pipeline job. As such, you need 
to create a pipeline job and register the callbacks that you want to use.

For example, a sample pipeline might look like

	// Sample pipeline...
	@Library('devops-framework')
	import org.devops.*
	
	// Include the core services as I want to use them as well...
	@GrabResolver(name='devops-core', root='file:///Volumes/WorkDisk/GROOVY/devops-framework/devops-framework-core/target/lib/')
	@Grab('org.devops.framework.core:devops-framework-core:0.0.1-SNAPSHOT')
	
	// Import the framework core classes...
	import org.devops.framework.core.*

	def config = [
	    property1: 'value1',
	    property2: 'value2',
	    property3: 'value3'
	]

	def bld = new org.devops.Build(this, config)

	node {    
	        File fetchDir = new File("/Volumes/WorkDisk/tmp/BuildJobs/")
		String scmURI = "https://github.com/sourcerepo/JavaAppCICD.git"
		String slackURI = "https://hooks.slack.com/services/SDJSHETEJDKRJFHFIDLODJFF"

		// Register my build process...    
		bld.runBuild(body:{
		    // This is a Maven which will compile and run all the unit tests as
		    // part of the process, so we do not need all the other build callbacks...
		    println ">Run build...<"
		    sh(script: "cd ${fetchDir.getAbsolutePath()}; chmod +rx ./mvnw; ./mvnw -q package")
		}, finalHandler:{ println ">Build Job Done<" })

		// Register my get code callback...
		bld.getCode(body:{
		    println ">Get code - cloning from GIT...<"
		    StringBuffer outputStr = new StringBuffer()
		    boolean retStat = SCM.scmClone(ConfigPropertiesConstants.SCMGIT,
						    scmURI,fetchDir,outputStr)
		    if (retStat) {
			println "Code clone worked"
			Notifications.messageSlackChannel(slackURI,"${label}: Clone worked")
		    } else {
			println "Code clone failed"
			println outputStr.toString()
			Notifications.messageSlackChannel(slackURI,"${label}: Code clone failed - "+outputStr.toString())
		    }  
		    outputStr = null
		}) 

		// Register my bake callback...
		bld.bakeImage(body:{ println ">Run my bake<" })

		// Register a prepareWorkArea callback...
		bld.prepareWorkArea(body:{
		    println ">Prepare Work Area - clean my files up...<"
		    if (fetchDir.exists()) {
			Utilities.deleteDirs(fetchDir)
		    }
		    fetchDir.mkdirs()
		})

		// Run my pipeline...
		bld.runPipeline()
	}

This will run the `prepareWorkArea()`, `getCode()`, `runBuild()` and `bakeImage()` callbacks in this
order.

A DSL plugin example would look like this

	// Sample DSL plugin calls...
	node {

	    // Clone code...
	    stage('clone') {
		// Some constants...
		String fetchDirG = "/Volumes/WorkDisk/tmp/BuildJobs/git/"
		String fetchDirS = "/Volumes/WorkDisk/tmp/BuildJobs/svn/"
		String scmURI = "https://github.com/jenkinsci/dimensionsscm-plugin.git"
		// Which host is the script running on?
		sh label: '', script: 'uname -a; hostname'

		def status = devOpsFrameworkGitCloneStep repoName: scmURI,
			 targetDir: fetchDirG
		println status

		status = devOpsFrameworkSvnCloneStep repoName: scmURI,
			 targetDir: fetchDirS
		println status
	    }

	    // Container ops with Docker...
	    stage('container-ops') {

		def status = devOpsFrameworkPullContainerStep containerName: 'tomcat'
		println status

		status = devOpsFrameworkRunContainerStep cmdStr: 'ls -l /',
				containerName: 'tomcat'
		println status

		status = devOpsFrameworkPushContainerStep imageName: 'pushImage'
		println status

		status = devOpsFrameworkTagContainerStep containerName: 'tomcat',
					targetName: 'yumi-target'
		println status

		status = devOpsFrameworkRmContainerStep containerName: 'tomcat', force: true
		println status

		status = devOpsFrameworkBuildContainerStep buildDirectory: '/home/Jenkins/workspace/TestDSL/',
				containerFile: '/home/Jenkins/workspace/TestDSL/DockerFileSuse.test',
				containerName: 'dsfsdf'
		println status

		// Ansible - not container op...
		status = devOpsFrameworkAnsibleRunbookStep hostFile: '/etc/ansible_hosts',
			    runFile: '/tmp/playbook.yml',
			    workingDir: '/tmp'
		println status
	    }
	}
	
Framework Documentation
=======================
The framework code comes with some limited JavaDoc present which can be used to generate API documentation
by using the command

	% mvn gplus:generateStubs gplus:groovydoc

This will generate JavaDoc style comments in the `target/` directory

Class Usage Examples and Running Unit-tests
===========================================
Virtually all the class functions documented above have example [unit/functional tests](https://github.com/tpayne/devops-framework/tree/master/devops-framework-core/src/test/java/org/devops/framework/core) which are run in the Maven test phase.

You can use these as examples to show you how to use the classes. 

Running the unit-tests
----------------------
The values used in the unit-tests for things like slack channels and GitHub repos are currently hardcoded to working values.
However, these will need to be changed if you wish to run the tests. These values are located in a properties file 
[`unitTest.properties`](https://github.com/tpayne/devops-framework/blob/master/devops-framework-core/src/test/resources/unitTest.properties). 

These will need to be modified to values more specific for you otherwise some of the tests may fail.

(Note - The tests have very little documentation imbedded in them currently. This will be added slowly).

Pipeline Examples
=================
Examples of pipelines created using the framework can be found in the [`examples`](https://github.com/tpayne/devops-framework/tree/master/devops-framework-pipeline/examples) directory.

>| Example | Description | 
>| ------ | ----------- |

DSL Plugin
==========
As well as the framework objects above, the framework also provides a HPI DSL plugin which when loaded into Jenkins (as a
normal plugin) adds a number of service steps which can be used in your Jenkins pipeline to get your CI/CD process
off the ground. These service steps are as follows.

Known Issues Notes
==================
The following are known issues: -
- The framework has not been fully ported or tested on Windows. Do not be surprised if some work needs to be done to make it work on that OS. Where possible classes have been written to support both UNIX and Windows, but they have not been tested on Windows, so some issues may occur. The framework was developed and tested on Unix.
- The Jfrog-cli is not currently supported in the Artifactory classes. This will be added later on.
- Currently, the framework can run both with in and without of Jenkins (if so required), but this duality is not guaranteed to be maintained in the future.
- Container singletons have been provided to show how they can be created, but these have not been verified in usage
- Due to a "feature" with Jenkins, any process which takes 5+ mins to run will be killed by Jenkins. This is core Jenkins pipeline and cannot be overriden without writing a custom threading plugin. The Jenkins developers seem to regard long running jobs as errors. To overcome this you will need to use the DevOps-framework DSL plugin for Jenkins. DSL functions have been added that provide the same functionality, but remove the time issue.
- Any changes on this branch are automatically built & unit-tested for completeness using Travis-CI. If you want to view the job history, click on the 'build' status icon at the beginning on this README.
